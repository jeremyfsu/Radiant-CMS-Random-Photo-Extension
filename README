= Random Photo

Adds a Radiant tag called r:random_photo that selects a random photo from a specified
directory with each page load.

Installation:
git clone this to your vendor/extensions directory

Example:
<r:random_photo dir="images/slideshow" />
Will render an IMG tag with the src being a randomly selected
a photo from public/images/slideshow.

The dir property is optional, not including it will cause random_photo to look in public/images.
