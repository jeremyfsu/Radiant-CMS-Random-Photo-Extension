= Random Photo

Adds a Radiant tag called r:random_photo that selects a random photo from a specified
directory with each page load.

Installation:
cd /root/to/your/radiant/app/
git clone git@github.com:jeremyfsu/Radiant-CMS-Random-Photo-Extension.git vendor/extensions/random_photo

Usage:
<r:random_photo dir="images/slideshow" />
Will render an IMG tag with the src being a randomly selected photo from public/images/slideshow.

The dir property is optional, not including it will cause random_photo to look in public/images.
